Hi! Welcome to the official OpenFPS documentation. Here, you can find guides on how to get up and running with FPS Core and the SMG-30.

Please be aware that although I continue to host FPS Core and it's documentation here, this project has not been in active development for some time. I kindly ask that you limit requests and emails to just bug fixes and issues with this website, thanks!
